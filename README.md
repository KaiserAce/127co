## Some Notes

Each department has a dedicated file for their respective `sql` queries in the `database/` folder.
Make sure you source each file on the `database/init.sql` file.

## Running the Project

This project assumes that you have `mysql` installed and on your `PATH`.

```bash
# install node dependencies
npm install

# run the frontend and the server
npm run dev
```

You can also invoke

```bash
npm run format
```

to automatically format your code before making a PR.
